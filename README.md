## Introduction : Gola of project : In the modern retail landscape, efficient and accurate data management is crucial for the smooth operation and success of any supermarket. The Supermarket Management System Database project aims to develop a comprehensive database solution that streamlines various aspects of supermarket operations, from inventory management and sales tracking to customer relationship management and business analytics.
## This project will encompass the entire lifecycle of database development, including the design, implementation, and deployment phases. The end goal is to create a robust and scalable database in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) that supports the supermarket's business needs and provides actionable insights through advanced reporting and data analytics tools such as Power BI.
# Project Goals
## Create ERD: Design a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for supermarket operations.
## Convert ERD to Schema: Translate the ERD into a formal database schema with all necessary tables, keys, and constraints.
## Create Database in MSSQL: Implement the schema in Microsoft SQL Server, setting up the database structure.
## Gather Business Information: Identify key business questions to guide decision-making.
## Create Data Model: Develop a data model optimized for performance and scalability.
## Create Data Warehouse: Design and implement a data warehouse for comprehensive reporting and analysis.
## ETL in SSIS: Use SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to develop an ETL process to populate the data warehouse.
## Create Reports in Power BI: Develop interactive reports in Power BI to visualize data and provide business intelligence.
